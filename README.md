# 📝 Drag-and-Drop Form Builder

A minimalistic, interactive drag-and-drop form builder web app that allows users to design custom forms with various elements such as headings, inputs, paragraphs, textareas, radio buttons, checkboxes, and selects. Users can preview and submit the form, with final data stored in `localStorage` and displayed on a separate page.
